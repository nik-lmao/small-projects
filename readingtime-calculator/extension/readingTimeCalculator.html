        <h1>Reading Time Calculator</h1>
        <p>This browser extension was made to calculate the reading time on websites. It will show a small popup on any site which tells you how long you'll have to read the contents of the page.</p>
        <h2>How to use it...</h2>
        <p>Just install the extension and it will work automatically. You don't have to do anything else. It will show the reading time in the bottom left corner of the page when you visit a page with text on it. If you don't want to see the pop-up anymore you can just click on it and it will close itself.</p>
        <h2>How it works...</h2>
        <p>On page load, this extension takes every p element from the page and puts it into a string. After the words in the string get counted and divided by 230 (average human reading speed). A new element is created and displayed in the bottom left corner. Its text content shows the reading time in minutes.</p>
